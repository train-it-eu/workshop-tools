# [Modern C++ Toolset](https://train-it.eu/trainings/cpp/75-cmake-conan) Workshop

The preferred way to run this workshop is to use [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/) by just clicking the button below to create a new workspace or by selecting an already created [Gitpod.io workspace](https://gitpod.io/workspaces).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/train-it-eu/workshop-tools)

Select:

- Standard class (up to 4 cores)
- VS Code editor in a browser

_Note: Consider pinning the workspace in [Gitpod.io workspace list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) so it is
not automatically deleted by Gitpod after 14 days of inactivity._

## Compilation

1. Do not select any 3rd party `CMakeLists.txt`. We will create our own during the workshop ;-)
1. Pick CMake Kit for the latest compiler of your choice in VSCode.

## Sharing Running Workspace

During the workshop we will be collaborating with other participants by sharing the IDE.
In order to share the Gitpod workspace with the rest of the group:

1. Click on the "Share" button on the bottom bar in VSCode.
2. Share the access URL with the rest of the team.
